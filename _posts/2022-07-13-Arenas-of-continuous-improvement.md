My go-to process for learning is Deliberate Practice†. In that process one must identify skills in which to focus attention.

A mental model I'm experimenting with to identify skills on-the-job to work on is:

Examples given are for a software engineer:

1. You have “arenas” that you can use your skills in; code, PRs, standup, retro, pairing
2. There are artefacts (code, dbs, tickets) and people (colleagues) in those arenas
3. There are “skills” (I include mindset here) that you use in those arenas

Plan - XXXX (I'll give an example in a second)

What I'm thinking is - it's the interaction between all 3 (arena, artefacts/people, skills) that defines the outcome. Each one is an variable that we can change to make the day more interesting and educational.

I can use the model in the following way:

1. When working on this jira ticket today
2. I'll be working with the codebase that interacts with MongoDB
3. I'll be using my MongoDB skills, specifically reading and writing documents

Plan - I will focus on improving my MongoDB skills, I'll research best practices for reading/writing multiple documents, maybe there's a more terse way of doing it or I can do it in fewer operations?

With this plan I'm mindful of what I'm going to be doing, I can be _deliberate_ about my practice. Better still, if I'm working with someone who can mentor me I can adjust my plan accordingly:

Plan - I will focus on improving my MongoDB skills, I'll ask Sarah to pair with me on this ticket and make it explicit that I'm trying to develop my skills here.

Maybe I'll come back to this article and update it if I find success/failure in this mental model. Or let me know if you find it useful!
