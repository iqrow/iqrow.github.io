Gold dust scatted throughout the book, and needing to read every page to get it?

How objective is it? I feel it's fairly subjective, but perhaps it's a little of both (I wonder about those top highlights in Kindle, or Medium).

It's also contextual, to the zeitgeist, to the problem at hand and the current knowledge of the reader. Coming back to things years later, or with a different problem to solve can turn an "OK read" into the most insightful.

For example right now I'm reading Radical Focus because I want help to set great OKRs, without undue avoidable stress or anxiety. This book would be far less impactful at another time of year.

A graph of usefulness over time would show spikes on the y axis of usefulness at certain points on the x axis. Like a wave pattern, perhaps a potentially harsh cliff past the first of the month, before building towards the start of the next quarter.

Think children looking at cut out silhouettes and then being able to come back to them and think of the names.
