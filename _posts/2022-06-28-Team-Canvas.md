States [[Team Canvas][http://theteamcanvas.com/]

My coach Nic first put me onto Team Canvases, and I had my first opportunity to use one today.

I ran it with a new team that's "launching" in a few days.

**It was an excellent activity, and I highly recommend it.**

We used the "advanced" format (or at least not the Basic), there's a template in Miro that you can use.

**Lessons learnt**

- Expect it to take longer than the 90-120 mins it states without constant vigilance
- Be prepared to leave very interesting conversations for "another time".†
- Have each person pick a colour of sticky from the start so you know who wrote what

† This was very very difficult for me as a curious talker, somebody wrote "bushcraft" as a strength and I didn't have time to ask about it! You *know* I'm looking forward to my next catch up with that person!
