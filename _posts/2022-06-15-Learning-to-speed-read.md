Thanks to Learnerbly and the generous learning budget, I've now got wayyy too many books on the shelf that I have yet to read.

Even at my current rate of about 1.5 books a month, it's going to take me 5 years to get through the _current_ pile, let alone the size of this pile 5 years from now.

*But is it a real thing?*, Like, I legit don't know. I'm going into this with a load of scepticism, I'm expecting the space to be full of just-buy-my-course and get-rich-quick vibes.

Does it work? Can I learn to speed read and not sacrifice comprehension? I'm going to give it a go and bring you along with me if you'll come.

But before we begin; let's start with a measurement.

## What are the practicable skills?

**Read just the middle** - read less

**Reduce Subvocalisation** - increase speed

One of first things I hear about is "subvocalisation" which is your little inner reading voice. Apparently you can stop this? Like there's another level after "stop reading out loud" where you "stop reading _in_ loud".

**Use a pointer** - read smoothly
