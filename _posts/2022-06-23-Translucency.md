These are the public slack channels that they could find through searching the channel directory.

We tell ourselves we're saving people from "all the messages" they'd have to read, or "it's only status updates, you already know this stuff".

We tell ourselves that this is being transparent, but it's not - it's being translucent.

Today I learned this lesson, as we have 'steering' channels and 'leadership updates' that fall into these two categories respectively, and when a team mate 'discovered' these updates they weren't happy and felt they should be made 'public'.

Public in this case means transparent, not translucent - it should be clear to people that these things exist.

There's more discussion to be had around what kind of communication goes where, but that's not what this article is about. The first step is to make sure people are clear on where they can find all communication.

I ask the reader to consider their own communication, do you have any translucent channels or pages that you should make clearer to people?

Maybe share them with your team mates today.
