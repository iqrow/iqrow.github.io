## How to move quickly with shared understanding?

When is an artefact (document, video, audio) better than a conversation?

Should you only ever have face-to-face conversations about things, or should you write everything down? How many "musts" should your tickets "have"? Should everything have a "must be informed", "must be consulted", "acceptance tests", "acceptance criteria", "linked design", "release"... and so on? Or is simply a single Japanese kanji as a title enough to get the work done on adding Japanese as a language to the platform?

Whilst the easy answer might be "It Depends" or separating concerns, I'm trying to do some systems thinking on how to min-max this problem.

## Shared Understanding

The desired outcome for me here is "shared understanding" in all things (insert image of the 3 people thinking about square, triangle, and circle).

From recent reading around User Stories and User Story Mapping the concept that a story is a "placeholder for a conversation" and that conversations have a much higher success rate in achieving shared understanding.

And of course... the Agile Manifesto:

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

# But Conversations are "sync" and blocking!

For example when should a stream-aligned team have the answer to the question: "Which audience is this release for, All or a segment?"

When - either:
1. Before it's needed (might never be needed, equivalent of over fetching, wasteful)
2. When it's needed (might slow down if finding out takes too long)
3. It's never needed (ideal, less load, less friction)

Where - Either:
1. No one knows -> Make a decision
2. 1 knows -> sync (can be more expensive and blocking but with good communication can lead to best shared understanding)
3. 1 place -> async (requires an upfront cost for all information, and discoverability and can lead to misunderstanding, but isn't blocking)

Ideally then:
1. Minimize "Things to know"
2. Minimize "Time to know"

I need to read Thinking in Systems.

# Benefits of "writing things down"

- Reduce cognitive load (less in my mental RAM)
- Some _thing_ objective that we can all collaborate on

Creating an artefact creates the 'thing' to come around and discuss.

Maybe this a virtuous cycle of "thing -> conversation -> new thing(s) -> conversation(s) -> repeat"
