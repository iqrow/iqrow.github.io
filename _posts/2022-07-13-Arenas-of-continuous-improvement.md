My go-to process for learning is Deliberate Practice†. In that process one must identify skills in which to focus attention.

What follows is a mental model I'm experimenting with.

The model seems useful for identifying skills that can be developed day to day on-the-job. The following examples are for a software engineer.

**Example:**

1. You have “arenas” that you can use your skills in; code, PRs, standup, retro, pairing
2. There are artefacts (code, dbs, tickets) and people (colleagues) in those arenas
3. There are “skills” (I include mindset here) that you use in those arenas

_Plan - XXXX (I'll give an example in a second)_

What I'm thinking is - it's the interaction between all 3 (arena, artefacts/people, skills) that defines the outcome. Each one is an variable that we can change to make the day more interesting and educational.

I can use the model in the following way:

**Example:**

1. When working on this jira ticket today that requires reading and writing to a database
2. I'll be working an app that uses MongoDB
3. I'll be using my MongoDB skills, specifically reading and writing documents

*Plan - I will focus on improving my MongoDB skills, I'll research best practices for reading/writing multiple documents, maybe there's a more terse way of doing it or I can do it in fewer operations?*

With this plan I'm mindful of what I'm going to be doing, I can be _deliberate_ about my practice. Better still, if I'm working with someone who can mentor me I can adjust my plan accordingly:

**Example:**
1. When working on this jira ticket today that requires reading and writing to a database
2. I'll be working in an app that uses MongoDB, in a team with Sarah who's a MongoDB expert
3. I'll be using my MongoDB skills when working on this ticket, specifically reading and writing documents

_Plan - I will focus on improving my MongoDB skills, I'll ask Sarah to pair with me on this ticket and make it explicit that I'm trying to develop my skills here._

By asking myself "what are the skills of my team mates I'm working with?", I'm being more mindful of one of the variables(artefacts/people in that arena) and it opens up a different learning opportunity. An arguably better one.

Maybe I'll come back to this article and update it if I find success/failure in this mental model. Or let me know if you find it useful!
